# Repository Overview 
This repository contains tools and workflows for optimizing Continuous Integration (CI) performance by reusing minified versions of R packages. By caching and retrieving precompiled historical versions of R packages, we significantly reduce build times and conserve CI resources.
# Project Background
The project addresses inefficiencies in current CI workflows that involve rebuilding and reinstalling R packages for each job run. By leveraging artifact caching and minimizing package installations, this approach enhances time efficiency and speeds up job runs.
# Key Features
- Artifact Caching & Retrieval: Utilizes GitHub Actions to store and retrieve precompiled versions of R packages, avoiding redundant compilations.

- Minimized Package Installation: Reduces package size and installation time by excluding non-essential components such as documentation, vignettes, and tests.

- Integration with GitHub Actions: Automatically checks for cached artifacts and either downloads or builds and caches minified versions as needed.
